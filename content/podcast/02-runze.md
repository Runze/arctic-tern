Amazingly, I had waited for a whole episode to talk about myself.

About a month ago, I was laid off from my job. As an immigrant working on an H-1B visa, I had exactly 60 days to find another job or risked losing my chance of staying. Fortunately, I managed to find one within the timeframe.

The experience taught me a lot of things, most importantly, my own self-worth, which is easy to downplay in the face of obstacles. Hence, I wanted to share my story with everyone who is going through similar situations and reassure you that your worth is not determined or undermined by external factors. Instead, it is exactly what you believed it to be.
