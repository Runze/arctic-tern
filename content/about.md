> The Arctic tern *(Sterna paradisaea)* is a tern in the family Laridae... The species is strongly migratory, seeing two summers each year as it migrates along a convoluted route from its northern breeding grounds to the Antarctic coast for the southern summer and back again about six months later... These are by far the longest migrations known in the animal kingdom.

Arctic Tern is a podcast about immigrants. In each episode, I interview an immigrant whose experience interests me, inspires me, and challenges me. Yes, due to cultural and societal differences, we are undeniably different, but at the end of the day, I hope you will find that we are in fact comically and encouragingly all the same.
